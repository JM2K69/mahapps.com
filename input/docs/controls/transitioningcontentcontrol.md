Title: TransitioningContentControl
---

Taken from Silverlight (specifically [this](https://github.com/jenspettersson/WPF-Controls) port), `TransitioningContentControl` is great for switching content smoothly around. 
At it's core, `TransitioningContentControl` is a `ContentControl`, so only one child element can be displayed at a time.
When you change the content, an animation is played switching the two.

`<Controls:TransitioningContentControl x:Name="transitioning" Width="150" Height="50" Transition="DownTransition" />`

Built in there are several transitions:  

* Default
* Down
* Up
* Right
* Left
* RightReplace
* LeftReplace
* Custom
