Title: Flyouts
---

A flyout is an overlay for a window that has custom content.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/flyout-demo-dark.png" style="width: 800px;"/>

Add the following code to your `MetroWindow`:

```xml
<Controls:MetroWindow.Flyouts>
    <Controls:FlyoutsControl>
        
    </Controls:FlyoutsControl>
</Controls:MetroWindow.Flyouts>
```

This is the container for the flyouts.
Inside this container add the following:

```xml
<Controls:Flyout Header="Flyout" Position="Right" Width="200">
    <!-- Your custom content here -->
</Controls:Flyout>
```

This creates a flyout with a header, sliding out from the right side of the window and has a width of 200.

The `Position` property can have the values

```
    Left,
    Right,
    Top,
    Bottom
```

### Themed flyouts
As of version 0.12, flyouts can have various themes, assignable through the `Theme` property, those are:

```
    Adapt,
    Inverse,
    Dark,
    Light,
    Accent
```

- `Adapt` adapts the flyout theme to the host window's theme.  
- `Inverse` has the inverse theme of the host window's theme.  
- `Dark` will always be the dark theme, this is also the default value.  
- `Light` will always be the light theme.  
- `Accent` adapts the flyout theme to the host window's theme, it looks like this for the blue theme:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/flyout-demo-accent.png" style="width: 800px;"/>

### WindowCommandsOverlayBehaviorn

`MetroWindow` has overlay properties for `LeftWindowCommands`, `RightWindowCommands`, `WindowButtonCommands` and the `Icon` to handle the topmost status, even if a flyout is shown.

```
public WindowCommandsOverlayBehavior LeftWindowCommandsOverlayBehavior
public WindowCommandsOverlayBehavior RightWindowCommandsOverlayBehavior
public WindowCommandsOverlayBehavior WindowButtonCommandsOverlayBehavior
public WindowCommandsOverlayBehavior IconOverlayBehavior
```

These are the values for `WindowCommandsOverlayBehavior`

```
Never // Doesn't overlay flyouts nor a hidden TitleBar.
Flyouts // Overlays opened Flyout controls.
HiddenTitleBar // // Overlays a hidden TitleBar.
Always
```
